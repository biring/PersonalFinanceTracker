# PersonalFinanceTracker

The Personal Finance Tracker is a Java software application designed to help users manage and track their personal finances efficiently. The application provides tools for expense tracking, budgeting, and financial reporting, empowering users to make informed financial decisions and achieve their financial goals. 

## Purpose

This project demonstrates my ability to:

- Write clean, maintainable, and modular code in Java.
- **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)**: Utilizes key OOP concepts such as encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism throughout the codebase to ensure flexibility and reusability.
- Implement the **Model-View-Controller (MVC)** design pattern for clear separation of concerns:
  - **Model**: Manages data like bank accounts, transactions, and budgets.
  - **View**: Displays data and handles user interactions (text-based interface).
  - **Controller**: Processes user input, updates the model, and refreshes the view.
- Follow **Object-Oriented Analysis and Design (OOAD)** principles to create a structured, maintainable system with well-defined objects and relationships. 
- Ensure reliability and correctness by writing **JUnit unit tests** for core functionality. 
- Automate the build process and manage build versioning using **batch scripts** as part of the **Git workflow**.

The project adheres to:
- **GRASP (General Responsibility Assignment Software Patterns)**: Ensures logical and maintainable responsibility assignment.
- **SOLID Principles**: Promotes scalable and flexible object-oriented design.
- **DRY Principle**: Reduces redundancy by encouraging reusable and clean code.
- **KISS Principle**: Keeps the design simple and easy to understand.

## Features

- **Bank and Credit Card Management**: Create and manage accounts.
- **Transaction Handling**: Import transactions from CSV files and automatically categorize them using regular expressions.
- **Categorization**: Dynamically categorize transactions with customizable regex patterns, simplifying the sorting of expenses.
- **Budgeting**: Set monthly budgets and track performance via monthly reports.
- **Reports**: Generate financial reports to track spending and budget performance.
- **Lightweight Data Persistence**: JSON-based storage offers portability for backing up and transferring data.

## Future Enhancements

- Transition to a **graphical user interface (GUI)** for improved usability, using JavaFX or Swing.
- Integrate support for **SQL database** storage to enhance scalability and reliability for enterprise-grade applications.
- Enhance reporting with **visualizations** like graphs and charts, making it easier to track financial goals.

### Why This Project Matters

This application addresses the common need for personal finance management, providing users with a clear view of their finances. It uses modern design principles and scalable architecture to ensure it can evolve with future demands, such as adding a GUI, supporting SQL databases, or enhancing reporting with visualizations.
